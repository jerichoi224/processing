# Processing Experiments

Just me trying out stuff with Processing in attempt to get a better understanding of the language

01. Circle Testing
- Just an attempt to recreate the web app shown in the welcome screen of the Official "Hello Processing" Tutorial

02. Line Art

- Got the Idea from the application above, thought it would be cool to have alot of dots-only that are connected.
- Creates a random, everchanging image.
- Left-Click to Save the frame.

03. Maze Maker (Square)

- A Random Maze Generator, with a path from the top left to bottom right.
- Speed isn't the best, IMO. Instant up to 500 * 500. Unsuccessful in making a 1000 * 1000.
