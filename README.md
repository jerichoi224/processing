Just me trying out stuff with Processing

01. Circle Testing
- Just an attempt to recreate the web app shown in the welcome screen of the Official "Hello Processing" Tutorial

02. Line Art

- Got the Idea from the application above, thought it would be cool to have alot of dots-only that are connected.
- Creates a random, everchanging image.
- Left-Click to Save the frame.
